# Mentoring Program

### Spring 2021

We are launching a new mentoring program for ISEE NAC members. We plan to create groups of 5 members that we recommend meet monthly via Zoom for the next year. We will initially provide groups with topics to discuss but then groups will become self-directed. Feedback will be solicited midway through the program. 

We thank all ISEE NAC members who expressed interest in the program! We are currently building the groups and we will be launching the program shortly.
