</p>

[Carrie Breton](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/carrie-breton/){target="_blank"}, ScD, is Professor of Population and Public Health Sciences at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. The overarching goals of her research program are to understand how environmental exposures early in life contribute to the increased risk of disease later in life, as well as the role genetic and epigenetic mechanisms play in driving observed associations. Despite evidence from animal models supporting a developmental origins of adult disease hypothesis (DOHad), which proposes that adverse events during early life program an increased risk for numerous adult diseases, human studies of in utero or childhood environmental exposures have not been a primary focus until recently. Her work in evaluating prenatal air pollution and prenatal tobacco smoke exposures provides evidence that early life exposures are important risk factors for cardio-respiratory health in children and young adults.

</p>

[Shohreh Farzan](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/shohreh-f-farzan/){target="_blank"}, PhD, is Assistant Professor of Population and Public Health Sciences at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. Dr. Farzan’s research focuses on the impact of environmental contaminants on maternal-child health, with a special interest in cardiometabolic health. Much of Dr. Farzan’s work focuses on the role of environmental exposures in altering preclinical indicators of cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk, particularly during vulnerable lifestages, such as childhood and pregnancy. Within the Maternal and Developmental Risks of Environmental and Social Stressors (MADRES) study, a NIMHD-funded Center of Excellence on Environmental Health Disparities Research, she focuses on the role of prenatal air pollutants and psychosocial stressors on maternal postpartum cardiometabolic health.
