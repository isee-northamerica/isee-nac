# Carrie Breton, Co-Chair

</p>

[Carrie Breton](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/carrie-breton/){target="_blank"}, ScD, is Professor of Population and Public Health Sciences at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. The overarching goals of her research program are to understand how environmental exposures early in life contribute to the increased risk of disease later in life, as well as the role genetic and epigenetic mechanisms play in driving observed associations. Despite evidence from animal models supporting a developmental origins of adult disease hypothesis (DOHad), which proposes that adverse events during early life program an increased risk for numerous adult diseases, human studies of in utero or childhood environmental exposures have not been a primary focus until recently. Her work in evaluating prenatal air pollution and prenatal tobacco smoke exposures provides evidence that early life exposures are important risk factors for cardio-respiratory health in children and young adults.

</p> 

[Shohreh Farzan](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/shohreh-f-farzan/){target="_blank"}, PhD, is Assistant Professor of Population and Public Health Sciences at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. Dr. Farzan’s research focuses on the impact of environmental contaminants on maternal-child health, with a special interest in cardiometabolic health. Much of Dr. Farzan’s work focuses on the role of environmental exposures in altering preclinical indicators of cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk, particularly during vulnerable lifestages, such as childhood and pregnancy. Within the Maternal and Developmental Risks of Environmental and Social Stressors (MADRES) study, a NIMHD-funded Center of Excellence on Environmental Health Disparities Research, she focuses on the role of prenatal air pollutants and psychosocial stressors on maternal postpartum cardiometabolic health.

</p>

[Jessie Buckley](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3357/jessie-p-buckley){target="_blank"}, PhD, is an Associate Professor of Environmental Health & Engineering and Epidemiology (joint) at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Her research focuses on characterizing exposures to environmental chemicals during early life and determining their effects on child development. As a recipient of a NIEHS Outstanding New Environmental Scientist (ONES) Award, she is studying the impacts of endocrine disrupting chemical mixtures on bone health during adolescence. In addition, Dr. Buckley serves as Director of Chemical Exposure Methodology for the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Data Analysis Center at Johns Hopkins where she oversees and collaborates on solution-oriented research focused on children’s health and the environment.

</p>

[Aisha Dickerson](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3898/aisha-s-dickerson){target="_blank"}, PhD, is Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Her research evaluates the impact of environmental exposures on neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, with a focus on underserved communities.

</p>

[Jaime Madrigano](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/4342/jaime-madrigano){target="_blank"}, ScD, is an environmental epidemiologist and Associate Professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Her research focuses on environmental and social determinants of health, including air pollution, neighborhood environments, and extreme weather and disasters. Prior to joining Johns Hopkins, she was an environmental epidemiologist and policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, an Assistant Professor at Rutgers University, and an Earth Institute Fellow at Columbia University. Dr. Madrigano received her Sc.D. in epidemiology and environmental health from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

# Scott Weichenthal

</p>

[Scott Weichenthal](https://scottweichenthal.weebly.com){target="_blank"}, PhD, is an Associate Professor in the Department of  Epidemiology and Biostatistics at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. His research program is dedicated to identifying and evaluating environmental risk factors for chronic illnesses such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. To support this objective, Dr. Weichenthal develops new approaches to population-based exposure assessment and examines how the urban built environment influences environmental exposures at both the individual and population-level. His past studies have examined the health effects of air pollution from biomass burning, traffic (e.g., ultrafine particles), as well as the oxidative potential of fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5). His current research also examines the use of deep learning models in estimating environmental exposures using images and audio data.

</p>

**Kate Weinberger**, PhD, is an environmental epidemiologist at ICF whose current work is focused on the evaluation and synthesis of epidemiologic evidence across a wide range of environmental exposures. Prior to joining ICF, Dr. Weinberger received a PhD in environmental health sciences from Columbia University, completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Brown University’s School of Public Health, and served as a faculty member at the University of British Columbia.
