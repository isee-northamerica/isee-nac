Max Aung, PhD, MPH, is an Associate Research Scientist on the Science & Policy team at UCSF's Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment. In his role at PRHE, Max focuses on advancing the field of systematic review as the foundation for evidence-based decision making through the development of an evidence to decision framework for environmental health that includes principles that incorporate health equity, environmental justice, benefits, harms, feasibility, cost-benefits and quality of the evidence to inform health policy. Max’s research portfolio also integrates cutting-edge data science and statistics tools to investigate the biological mechanisms linking the prenatal exposure to adverse reproductive health outcomes. Prior to joining PRHE, Max completed doctoral training in Environmental Epidemiology and postdoctoral training in Biostatistics and Precision Health Data Science at the University of Michigan. Max is an alumnus of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Health Policy Research Scholars Fellowship.
